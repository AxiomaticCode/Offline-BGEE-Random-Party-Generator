# Offline-BGEE-Random-Party-Generator
A simple tool to make random party suggestions for the Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition series quickly and easily.

How to Launch:
Double-click the file that says "BGEE_Random_Party_Generator" and is an application type file, the icon should have a brown-ish color with a little circle in the middle.

If, like me, you like to start new games of BGEE over and over with the intention of doing a "no-reload" run, and if, like me, you get bored of making the same characters again and again, and you want some variety, then this is for you.

This software, when you click the "Generate My New Party" button, will randomly choose the gender, race, class, alignment and provide a short suggested name for the character.
All character details suggested should be valid for using in the BGEE games - (i.e. the software will not suggest you make a "good" aligned Blackguard, or a Dwarf Mage; these characters are not possible to make in the game)

You can tell the software not to give you any multi-class suggestions by un-ticking one of the boxes, or ONLY multi-class by clicking another box, and you can also have the software suggest only the "shorty" races of Dwarf, Gnome and Halfling if that's what you're in the mood of for your next game. And so on.

Hover your mouse over the tick boxes to see an explanation of what each option does.

The results appear horizontally next to the Protagonist, Character 1, Character 2 etc. boxes.

It's that simple. This readme can be updated if necessary to explain these things if it turns out it's not self-explanatory.
